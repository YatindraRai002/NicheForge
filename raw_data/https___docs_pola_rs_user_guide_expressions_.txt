Expressions We introduced the concept of “expressions” in a previous section . In this section we will focus on exploring the types of expressions that Polars offers. Each section gives an overview of what they do and provides additional examples. Essentials: Basic operations – how to do basic operations on dataframe columns, like arithmetic calculations, comparisons, and other common, general-purpose operations Expression expansion – what is expression expansion and how to use it Casting – how to convert / cast values to different data types How to work with specific types of data or data type namespaces: Strings – how to work with strings and the namespace str Lists and arrays – the differences between the data types List and Array , when to use them, and how to use them Categorical data and enums – the differences between the data types Categorical and Enum , when to use them, and how to use them Structs – when to use the data type Struct and how to use it Missing data – how to work with missing data and how to fill missing data Types of operations: Aggregation – how to work with aggregating contexts like group_by Window functions – how to apply window functions over columns in a dataframe Folds – how to perform arbitrary computations horizontally across columns User-defined Python functions – how to apply user-defined Python functions to dataframe columns or to column values Numpy functions – how to use NumPy native functions on Polars dataframes and series
